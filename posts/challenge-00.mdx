The 30 day front-end challenge is inspired by [HackerRank's 30 days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) and [100 days of CSS](https://100dayscss.com/). I decided to put a twist on both these challenges by recreating real UI elements from around the web for the next 30 days.

For day 0, I drew inspiration from [Vercel's design](https://vercel.com/). Some components that might look familiar are the minimalist black & white buttons (now on the [landing page](https://www.delbaoliveira.com/)) and the black dotted grid background above which can be found on the [Next.js Conf Website](https://nextjs.org/conf).

Jump to the challenges I've completed so far:

- Day 1: [Vercel's text slider](/blog/challenge-01)
- Day 2: [A like button that likes you back](/blog/challenge-02)
- Day 3: ...

If you have any ideas of what UI element I can tackle next, let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira)!
